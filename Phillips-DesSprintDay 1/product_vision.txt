Our product, ForgetMeNot, is for college students who have trouble remembering and are constantly missing dealines. These users need a platform that enforces accountability in a stronger way than a mere calendar. By seamlessly connecting with school accounts, Canvas, iCal feeds, and Slack, and then ruthlessly popping up with reminders, our app ensures users stay on track. With smart pop-up reminders and a gamified punishment system, the app goes beyond simple scheduling—it actively drives users to remember and act on their responsibilities. For forgetful users, we don't just assist—we insist. Unlike Google Calendar, which is easy to ignore, our app demands attention through persistent reminders and a reinforcement system that ensures tasks are remembered and completed. Our product enforces remembering through persistent reminders, smart integrations, and accountability features, ensuring users stay on track and never miss important tasks.
